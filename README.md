Eclipse Phase Second Edition Helper **now with discord webhooks !**

# How to use 
1. Create a webhook on your discord server following https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
1. Copy the Webhook URL and paste it on the "Discord hook" field on your character sheet
1. That's it ! Each roll you make will be sent to the discord channel of your webhook.

Note that you can use the same hook for every character in play as the name displayed will be the roll-making character name. However, you can also set one hook per character in order to assign them a custom avatar for simpler reading.
