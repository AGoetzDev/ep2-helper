        <p>Now that you have a rough orientation for your character’s background and skill sets, it’s time to pick a faction to which they hold allegiance. Each choice provides a <router-link to="/chargen/13">motivation</router-link> and a skill of Know: [Faction] 30. The Faction cards below provide a brief summary of each group; further details can be found on ▶152-174 EP2E.</p><p>If you are unsure of what faction to pick at this time, you may skip this section for now and determine your faction, motivation, and Know skill during gameplay. You also can choose not to have a faction — not everyone picks sides. If going factionless, simply choose your own motivation and take any Know skill you like at 30.</p><p>Faction allegiance does not necessarily mean you are a hardcore true believer. You may have been born or raised into a faction and reluctantly stuck with it, or you may be finding yourself questioning some of the faction’s tenets. You may be a dissident, trying to actively change the faction from within. For now, your faction allegiance indicates the transhuman grouping you are most familiar with and whose goals you at least nominally support. Perhaps you are even a defector or new recruit, with an Know skill in your old faction but a motivation tied to your new one.</p>

See the sections below depending on which you are using.</p><h4>If you are using the sheet on this website:</h4><p>The skills should already be on your sheet from using the 'add' buttons in the previous steps of character generation. However, you will need to redistribute any skill that has more than 80 total (this is the sum of the rank and the related aptitude, 2x aptitude in the case of Fray and Percieve). Redistribute the 'rank' of any skills that exceed this so that none of your skills have a total of over 80. You can only redistribute 'Know' skill points to other 'Know' skills (or add new 'Know' skills with the points).</p><p>Feel free to delete any extra skills off your sheet (except the 'default' ones which won't allow you to delete them).</p><p>In the end, no skill should show more than '80' in the 'Total' column.</p><h4>If you are using your own sheet:</h4><p>Combine all of the skills from Steps 1-4 and write them on your character sheet.</p><p>If a character acquired the same skill more than once, those points may be added together or the additional points may be applied to any other skill of the player’s choosing. Note that points for Know skills may only be used for other Know skills; however, points for Active skills may be used for either Active or Know skills.</p><p>Next, add the base aptitude values to their linked skills. Note that the skills of Fray and Perceive have base values equal to their aptitude × 2.</p><p>No final skill total (including aptitude) may exceed 80. Any points over 80 must be applied to another skill of the player’s choosing. Again, Know skill points may only be used for other Know skills.</p><p>Players should feel free to switch their skills for any other skills as long as the number of points remains the same, and as long as Know skill points only go toward other Know skills.</p><p>We suggest keeping aptitudes and skills in multiples of 5 for simplicity, but this is not a requirement.</p><p><b>Spending CP:</b> Each point of CP gets you 5 skill points. Use these points to purchase or raise any skills you think you’ll need.</p>

        <div class="header">Motivation</div>
        <p>Now that your character is mostly fleshed out, you must choose 3 motivations. Motivations are personal aspirations your character pursues. Most of these are long-term and rooted in the character’s ideological beliefs, personal drive, or backstory. Motivations will help your character earn extra Rez Points ▶366 EP2E and cope with mental stress and trauma ▶222 EP2E.</p><p>Motivations are listed on your character sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with a + or – symbol to denote whether they support the cause or oppose it. For example, “+Fame” would indicate that your character seeks to become a famous media personality, whereas “–Reclaim Earth” means that your character opposes the goal of reclaiming Earth.</p><p>Your first motivation is based on your faction choice, as determined in Step 4 ▶44. Note this on your sheet as “+[Faction] Interests.” Your other two motivations are based on your character’s personal interests; see the Example Motivations sidebar for ideas. If you did not choose a faction, simply choose a third personal motivation instead.</p><p>If you’re not sure what motivations to pick just yet, you can always leave them blank for now and fill them in during gameplay.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="header">Optional: Motivational Goals</div>
        <p>Motivations are good for steering your character, but they are very open-ended. To fine-tune the concept, list out a specific short-term goal for each motivation. For example, if your motivation is +Discover Your Past, your goal might be to investigate the habitat where you were re-instantiated with lack a few months after the Fall. If your motivation is +Argonaut Interests, your goal might be to liberate a specific cache of proprietary scientific data for all of transhumanity to use.</p><p>If your GM has a detailed campaign idea worked out in advance, you may want to wait and decide on your goals until you have been fully introduced to the setting so you can integrate them within the context of the story arc. For example, if your GM establishes a campaign about the liberation of Mars from hypercorp control, and you have +Mercurial Interests, you first goal might be to connect a mercurial group you support with the Barsoomians and establish common ground.</p><p>If your group prefers a more cooperative style of campaign development, motivational goals provide ample material for the GM to construct scenarios around. With this style of play, you may want to pick one motivation as your primary and establish multiple goals in relation to it. These goals can then serve as stepping stones for your character’s personal story arc.</p><p>For more interactive motivations, have each player choose one of the goals of another character. When doing so, they should specifically try to construct it in a way that connects it back to their own character. This is a great opportunity to establish shared interests, histories, and backgrounds between player characters.</p>
