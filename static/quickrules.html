                        <li>Target number is determined by the appropriate skill, aptitude check, or rep score.</li>
                        <li>Difficulty is represented by modifiers to this target number, assigned by the GM.</li>
                        <li>Your goal is to roll equal to or under the modified target number, but as high as possible.</li>
                        <li>A roll equal to or under the target number is a success. If the success roll is 33 or more, it is a superior success. If it is a 66 or more, it is two superior successes.</li>
                        <li>If your roll exceeds the target number, it is a failure. If the failed roll is under 66, it is a superior failure. If it is under 33, it counts as two superior failures.</li>
                        <li>Doubles (00, 11, etc.) equal a critical success or failure.</li>
                        <li>00 is always a critical success. 99 is always a critical failure.</li>
                        <li>If you do not have the appropriate skill, you may default to the skill’s linked aptitude, but critical successes are ignored.</li>

                    Hacking Tests are opposed tests, your Infosec skill VS. the target’s Firewall
                    <ul>
                        <li>When hacking a target, there are two methods you can go about it:</li>
                        <li>Brute-Force-Attacks are quick and noisy. They require a complex action and inflict a –30 modifier to your Hacking Tests. If you succeed, you have user privileges on the system but also spotted status (the system is aware of your intrusion).</li>
                        <li>Subtle Intrusions are quiet but take time. They are task actions with a timeframe of 1 hour. If you succeed, you have user privileges on the system and covert status (the system is unaware of your presence).</li>
                        <li>Each superior success on the Hacking Test increases your privileges one step (from user to security to admin).</li>
                        <li>A critical success on the Hacking Test increases your status one step (from spotted to covert to hidden).</li>
                        <li>When intruding, you do not need to make tests for actions your privileges allow. For other actions, you must succeed in additional Hacking Tests.</li>
